# top_14_prediction
This repository contains my project aiming at predicting the winning team of rugby games (top 14)

Given the needed features, I intend to create a algorithm that predict the winning team of a rugby game.

I scrapped the data from the French Rugby Leage website: lnr.fr
The main datasets are:
- The ranking after each day of the team
- the results of all the games of a day with some basic figures and statistics

It is compose of all the season from the season 2004/2005.
